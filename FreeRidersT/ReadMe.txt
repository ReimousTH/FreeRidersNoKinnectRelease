---[INSTALLATION]---
1. Get (or dump) a Sonic Free Riders copy and unpack it. Also it is recommended to backup default.xex file somewhere else on your computer.
2. Open RidersStuff folder and choose the version for your platform (Xenia or Xbox360)
3. Copy all files from the chosen folder to the root directory of your unpacked game
4. If everything's done correctly, the mod should work
5. If you're on PC and use Xenia, don't skip this step! Find a Xenia's configuration file (Documents folder or AppData/Roaming, if it's portable then in Xenia root directory) and set gpu_allow_invalid_fetch_constants to true and set protect_zero to false


---[KNOWN BUGS]---
Unfortunately, Xbox 360 requires a connected Kinect! Just connect the device and you can already pick up a gamepad.
4P and 3P multiplayer doesn't work!
Xenia can softlock (black screen) for some reason :|
Also Xenia only works with protect_zero = false for some reason :|
